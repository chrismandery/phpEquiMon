First all of read the COMPLETE phpEquiMon homepage INCLUDING the FAQ!

After reading the homepage:

- Unpack the archive to a temporary folder.

- Copy everything under htdocs/ in a path below your webroot.
  Rights should be 644 and owner root, group your webserver (usually one of www, apache, apache2, httpd).

- Setup config.php with your details about your desired database backend (use config.example.php as a basis).

- Run install.php from your browser and after success, delete it (otherwise an evil user can reset your database).

- Login using username admin, password admin and change all remaining settings in phpEquiMon's Admin Panel.

- With the stuff under util/ you can setup PXE servers and deploy monequip.example.sh (after modifying it to suit your
  configuration) to your machines for monitoring.

If you have any problems or questions, feel free to contact me via the SourceForge project tracker/forum or mail.

More documentation will follow with later releases.
